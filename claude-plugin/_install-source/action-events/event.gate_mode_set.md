title: Gate mode set
description: The operator has selected the gate mode and the pipeline can proceed under that policy.

  gate-mode:
    required: true
    description: Selected gate mode — one of `task`, `phase`, or `autonomous`.

Signal `gate_mode_set --gate-mode <chosen>` only after the operator has explicitly picked one of the three modes. Do not infer a value on ambiguous input. The selected mode determines whether per-task and per-phase gates pause for human approval downstream.
