Spawn the `rad-orc:planner` agent to read the project's requirements ledger and produce the inlined phase + task Master Plan. The agent's output is `{NAME}-MASTER-PLAN.md`.

Before spawning, inline `repository_skills_block` verbatim into the agent's spawn prompt. When that field is the empty string, omit it entirely.

Extract the master-plan doc path from the agent's final message.
