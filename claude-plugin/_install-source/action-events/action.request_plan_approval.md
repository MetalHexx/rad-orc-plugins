Present the Master Plan to the operator. Show the phase breakdown and task list so they can verify scope and sequencing before any code is written.

Ask the operator to approve or reject. Hold here until they respond — do not proceed autonomously regardless of gate-mode settings or auto-approval configuration.

Signal `plan_approved` when the operator approves. Signal `plan_rejected` when the operator rejects; the pipeline will route back to the planner for revision.
