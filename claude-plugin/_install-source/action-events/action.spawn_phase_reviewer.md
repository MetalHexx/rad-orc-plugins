Spawn the `rad-orc:reviewer` agent for phase-level review.

Pass `phase_first_sha` (the first task's initial commit) and `phase_head_sha` (the last task's latest commit, corrective-aware). When `source_control.auto_commit: never` or no commits have been made, pass both SHAs as `null`; the reviewer will fall back to `git diff HEAD` plus untracked files.

Extract the review doc path from the agent's final message.

When the reviewer's verdict is `changes_requested|rejected`, perform correction mediation before signaling.
