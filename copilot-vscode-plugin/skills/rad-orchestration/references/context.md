# Orchestration System Context

This workspace contains a **document-driven agent orchestration system** built on Copilot's native primitives (custom agents, skills, prompt files, and instruction files). The system takes software projects from idea through planning, execution, and review using 9 specialized agents.

## How It Works

- **Brainstorm an idea**: Use `@brainstormer` to collaboratively explore and refine a project idea before starting the pipeline. This is optional — you can skip straight to `@orchestrator` if you already have a clear idea.
- **Start a project**: Use `@orchestrator` with a project idea. The Orchestrator reads state and spawns specialized agents to advance the pipeline. If a `BRAINSTORMING.md` exists, it uses that as input.
- **Continue a project**: Use `@orchestrator` and ask to continue. It reads `state.json` to determine the next step automatically.
- **Check status**: Use `@orchestrator` and ask for project status. It reads `state.json` to determine the current status.

## Agents

| Agent | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| `@brainstormer` | Collaboratively brainstorms and refines project ideas — standalone, outside the pipeline |
| `@orchestrator` | Coordinates the pipeline — spawns agents, reads state, asks human questions. **Writes only**: `## Orchestrator Addendum` section + additive frontmatter on existing Code Review docs, and corrective Task Handoff files under `tasks/`. |
| `@planner` | Authors the lean Requirements ledger and inlined Master Plan via `rad-create-plans` |
| `@coder` | Executes coding tasks from self-contained task handoffs |
| `@coder-junior` | Executes simpler coding tasks with additional guardrails |
| `@coder-senior` | Executes complex coding tasks with expanded autonomy |
| `@reviewer` | Reviews code and phases against planning documents |

## Pipeline

```
Planning Process: Depends on the selected process template for the project.
Execution Process: Depends on the selected process template for the project.
Final:     Comprehensive Review → PR Creation (if auto_pr) → Human Approval → Complete
```

## Key Rules

1. **Start with `@brainstormer` (optional) or `@orchestrator`** — brainstorm ideas first, or go directly to the Orchestrator if you have a clear idea.
2. **The Coder reads ONLY its Task Handoff** — everything it needs is self-contained in that one document.
3. **No agent directly writes `state.json`** — all state mutations performed by the `@orchestrator` agent via the `radorch pipeline signal` subcommand.
4. **Human gates** are enforced after planning (Master Plan review) and after final review.
5. **Documents are the interface** — agents communicate through structured markdown files, never through shared state or memory.
6. **PR creation is non-blocking** — when `auto_pr === 'always'`, the pipeline creates a GitHub PR after the comprehensive review and before the human gate. If PR creation fails, the human gate fires without a PR URL. PR failure never blocks the pipeline.

## Configuration

System configuration lives in `~/.radorch/orchestration.yml`. It controls:
- Pipeline limits (max phases, tasks, retries)
- Human gate defaults

## Project Files

Project artifacts are stored at `~/.radorch/projects/{PROJECT-NAME}/`.

Contents:
- Brainstorming: `BRAINSTORMING.md` (optional, created by `@brainstormer`)
- Planning docs: `MASTER-PLAN.md` (inlined phase + task plan written by `@planner`), `REQUIREMENTS.md` (lean project-level ledger written by `@planner`)
- Execution docs: `phases/`, `tasks/`, `reports/`
- State: `state.json`
- Error log: `ERROR-LOG.md` (append-only, created by `@orchestrator` via `rad-log-error` skill)

## Naming Conventions

- **Project files**: `SCREAMING-CASE` with project prefix — `MYAPP-MASTER-PLAN.md`, `MYAPP-TASK-P01-T03-AUTH.md`. See [document-conventions.md](document-conventions.md) for the full set of filename patterns, placement rules, and frontmatter field values.
- **Skills**: lowercase with hyphens (e.g. `rad-create-plans`). The orchestrator resolves skills by name; physical placement varies by install path (harness folders for the legacy installer, plugin folder for the Claude plugin).
- **Agents**: lowercase with hyphens (e.g. `planner`). Resolved by name; same placement note as skills.
