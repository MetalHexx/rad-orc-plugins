# Pipeline Guide

Reference document for the Orchestrator agent. Covers the pipeline event loop, action routing, CLI usage, and error handling.

## Runtime Entry

The `radorch pipeline signal` subcommand is the pipeline entry point. All pipeline calls use this canonical form, with `${COPILOT_VSCODE_PLUGIN_ROOT}` resolving to the orchestration install root at runtime:

```
node "${COPILOT_VSCODE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/rad-orchestration/scripts/radorch.mjs" pipeline signal --event <event> --project-dir <dir> [--config <path>] [--template <name>]
    [--doc-path <path>]
    [--branch <name>] [--base-branch <name>] [--worktree-path <path>]
    [--auto-commit <always|never>] [--auto-pr <always|never>]
    [--remote-url <url>] [--compare-url <url>]
    [--gate-type <type>] [--reason <text>] [--gate-mode <mode>]
    [--commit-hash <hash>] [--pushed <true|false>] [--pr-url <url>]
```

## Pipeline Event Loop

The Orchestrator operates as an event-driven controller:

1. **Determine the event to signal** (see Event Signaling Reference below)
2. **Call the pipeline** using the canonical `radorch pipeline signal` form shown in Runtime Entry above
3. **Parse the JSON envelope from stdout** — `{ ok, data, error }` — and pattern-match `data.action` against the Action Routing Table
4. **Execute the action** (spawn agent, present gate, or display message)
5. **After the action completes**, determine the next event to signal based on the action's completion
6. **Go to step 2**

### First Call

Signal `--event start --project-dir <path>` for new projects, for continuing a project, and for recovery after context compaction. The `start` event is always safe — the pipeline loads `state.json`, skips mutation, and resolves the next action from the current state.

### CLI Invocation

Always invoke the subcommand from the workspace root using the canonical form shown in Runtime Entry above. The `--config` flag overrides the default config path; pass it alongside any other flags as needed.

### Loop Termination

The loop terminates when `data.action` is `display_halted` or `display_complete`. These are terminal actions with no follow-up event.

### Valid Pause and Stop Points

Only these `data.action` values should pause execution for human input or stop the loop:

| Action | Behavior |
|--------|----------|
| `display_halted` | Stop — display message, loop terminates |
| `display_complete` | Stop — display summary, loop terminates |
| `request_plan_approval` | Pause — wait for human approval |
| `request_final_approval` | Pause — wait for human approval |
| `gate_task` | Pause — wait for human approval |
| `gate_phase` | Pause — wait for human approval |
| `ask_gate_mode` | Pause — wait for operator gate mode selection |

All other actions must be executed immediately without asking the human.

## Action Routing Table

Every `data.action` value maps to exactly one Orchestrator operation. All branching derives from this table.

## Event Signaling Reference

These are the exact event names passed to `--event`:

## State Mutations

All state mutations are performed by the pipeline script internally — no agent writes `state.json` directly. The pipeline:

1. Receives an event via CLI
2. Validates the current state
3. Applies the appropriate mutation(s)
4. Validates the resulting state
5. Writes `state.json`
6. Returns the JSON envelope with `data.action`

The envelope's `data` block carries `action` (the next action for the Orchestrator to execute) and `context` (action-specific payload).

### Corrective Mediation on `code_review_completed`

When the pipeline returns `data.action` of `spawn_code_reviewer` and the reviewer returns a raw `verdict: changes_requested`, the orchestrator enters an in-session mediation flow **before** signaling `code_review_completed` to the pipeline. The full mediation procedure — per-finding judgment, addendum authoring, corrective Task Handoff creation, and budget enforcement — is defined in [`references/corrective-playbook.md`](references/corrective-playbook.md). When the reviewer returns `approved`, the orchestrator signals `code_review_completed` with no mediation fields and the event propagates normally. When the reviewer returns `rejected`, the orchestrator signals `code_review_completed` immediately (no mediation), and the mutation routes the rejected verdict into a clean pipeline halt. The orchestrator never flips an `approved` verdict to `changes_requested`.

### Corrective Mediation on `phase_review_completed`

When the pipeline returns `data.action` of `spawn_phase_reviewer` and the reviewer returns a raw `verdict: changes_requested`, the orchestrator enters the same in-session mediation flow **before** signaling `phase_review_completed` to the pipeline. The structure mirrors the task-scope case: the orchestrator reads each finding against the Phase Plan, Requirements, task handoffs, and cumulative phase diff; writes a `## Orchestrator Addendum` section and additive frontmatter (`orchestrator_mediated`, `effective_outcome`, `corrective_handoff_path`) to the phase review doc; and — when at least one finding is actioned — authors a self-contained corrective Task Handoff under `tasks/` with a `-PHASE-` sentinel in the filename (`{NAME}-TASK-P{NN}-PHASE-C{N}.md`). The corrective appends to `phaseIter.corrective_tasks[]` (not `taskIter.corrective_tasks`). See [`references/corrective-playbook.md`](references/corrective-playbook.md) for the full procedure, including the single-pass phase_review clause and ancestor-derivation rule for corrective-of-corrective routing. When the reviewer returns `approved` or `rejected`, no mediation fires and the event propagates normally.

## Error Handling

If the pipeline exits with code 1, the envelope carries error details:

```json
{
  "ok": false,
  "data": { "event": "task_completed", "field": "phase" },
  "error": { "type": "user_error", "message": "Validation failed: V6 — multiple in_progress tasks" }
}
```

| Category | Name | Description | Examples | Action |
|----------|------|-------------|----------|--------|
| 1 | Sequencing Error (Recoverable) | The Orchestrator signaled the wrong event or signaled out of order, but no agent output was produced or consumed. | Signaling `task-execute` before `task-plan` is complete; signaling an event for a phase that isn't active. | Log the error. Re-signal the correct event. Continue pipeline. |
| 2 | Stale State (Recoverable) | A state field is stale, null, or inconsistent due to a prior incomplete transition, but the underlying agent output is valid. | `current_phase` still references a completed phase; a task status is stuck at `in-progress` after completion is confirmed. | Log the error. Clear or correct the stale field. Re-signal the appropriate event. Continue pipeline. |
| 3 | Output Quality Error (Recoverable) | An agent produced an output file with malformed content, invalid frontmatter, wrong status values, or missing required sections. The Orchestrator cannot fix this programmatically. | pipeline returns unexpected type due to malformed frontmatter; agent output file is missing or empty; code review verdict is not one of the valid enum values. | Log the error with full context (file path, field name, expected vs. actual value). Display the error to the human operator. Halt the pipeline immediately. Do not attempt automatic recovery. |
| 4 | Critical issue with the project code itself (Unrecoverable) | The agent output is not just malformed, but indicates a critical failure in the codebase that prevents further progress. | Code produced that fails to compile or run at all, blocking all downstream work. | Log the error with full context. Halt the pipeline immediately. Do not attempt automatic recovery. |

**Default rule**: When an error does not clearly fit Category 1 or Category 2, or Category 3, treat it as **Category 4 (Halt)**. A false halt is recoverable by the human operator; a false recovery may corrupt pipeline state.

**On every `ok: false` envelope:**

1. **Classify** the error using the table above
2. **Log the error**: Invoke the `rad-log-error` skill to append a structured entry to `{NAME}-ERROR-LOG.md` in the project directory (e.g., `~/.radorch/projects/MYAPP/MYAPP-ERROR-LOG.md`). Populate the entry fields from the envelope:
   - **Pipeline Event**: from `data.event`
   - **Pipeline Action**: from `data.action` (or `N/A` if not present)
   - **Severity**: classify using the skill's severity guide (`critical` = blocks execution, `high` = incorrect state, `medium` = degraded behavior, `low` = cosmetic)
   - **Phase/Task**: from `data.field`
   - **Symptom**: describe the observable failure from `error.message`
   - **Pipeline Output**: the full raw JSON envelope
   - **Root Cause**: diagnose if obvious, otherwise "Under investigation."
   - **Workaround Applied**: describe recovery action, or "None — awaiting fix."
3. **Execute the category action**: Follow the Action column for the classified category. For Category 3, display `error.message` to the human and halt immediately.

## Recovery

On context compaction or agent restart, the Orchestrator has no runtime memory to recover. Recovery is a single `radorch pipeline signal` call with `--event start --project-dir <path>` using the canonical form shown in Runtime Entry above. The pipeline loads `state.json`, skips mutation, and resolves the next action from the current state. All state is persisted in `state.json` by the pipeline script, so no runtime memory is needed.

## Spawning Subagents

When spawning a subagent, always provide:

1. **Clear task description**: What the agent should do
2. **File paths**: Exact paths to input documents the agent needs to read
3. **Project context**: Project name, current phase/task numbers from `data.context`
4. **Output expectations**: Where to save the output document (derive from project naming conventions)

Example spawn instructions:
> "Create the requirements for the MYAPP project. If a brainstorming document exists at `~/.radorch/projects/MYAPP/MYAPP-BRAINSTORMING.md`, read that. Save the requirements to `~/.radorch/projects/MYAPP/MYAPP-REQUIREMENTS.md`."

### Source Control — PR Mode

When `data.action` is `invoke_source_control_pr`, spawn **source-control** in PR mode:

1. The agent reads `pipeline.source_control` from state for `branch`, `base_branch`, and `worktree_path`
2. The agent reads `final_review.doc_path` from state for the PR body file
3. The agent executes `radorch git pr` with the resolved flags
4. The agent outputs a `## PR Result` JSON block containing `pr_url` (which may be `null` on failure) and `pr_number`
5. Extract `pr_url` from the agent's `## PR Result` JSON block
6. If `pr_url` is non-null, signal `pr_created --pr-url <url>` to the pipeline; if `pr_url` is `null` (creation failed or pre-condition failure), signal `pr_created` **without** the `--pr-url` flag so the pipeline records the attempt as `null` and proceeds to the human gate

## Status Reporting

After every significant action, summarize to the human:
- What was just completed
- What the current state is
- What happens next

Keep status updates concise — 2-3 bullet points maximum.
