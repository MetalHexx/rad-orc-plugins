# Orchestration

Unified orchestration skill containing the pipeline runtime, validator, and role-specific reference documents. System configuration (`orchestration.yml`) and tier templates live at `~/.radorch/` and are documented below. All pipeline agents load this skill for system context.

## Reference Documents

Read `references/context.md` first. If your role appears in the table below with an additional reference, read that document too.

| Role | Reference Document | What It Provides |
|------|--------------------|-----------------|
| All agents | [references/context.md](references/context.md) | Agent roles, pipeline flow, naming conventions, key operating rules |
| Orchestrator | [references/pipeline-guide.md](references/pipeline-guide.md) | Event loop, action routing, CLI usage, state mutation patterns |
| Orchestrator | [references/action-event-reference.md](references/action-event-reference.md) | Complete Action Routing Table (16 actions) and Event Signaling Reference — quick lookup during pipeline operation |
| Orchestrator | [references/corrective-playbook.md](references/corrective-playbook.md) | Orchestrator-only. Mediation guide for `code_review_completed` with `verdict: changes_requested`. Read on every task-scope corrective cycle. |
| All agents | [references/document-conventions.md](references/document-conventions.md) | Document naming, placement, filename patterns, frontmatter field values |
