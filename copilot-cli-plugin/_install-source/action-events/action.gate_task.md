description: Present the completed task results to the operator and wait for approval before the pipeline advances to the next task.
category: gate
completion_event: task_gate_approved

Show the operator the task's outcome: the code-review verdict, any corrective cycles applied, and the final state of the handoff. Give them enough context to judge whether the task is acceptable before the pipeline moves on.

Ask the operator to approve or reject. Hold here until they respond. If they reject, collect a brief reason — the pipeline routes back to a corrective cycle using that reason.

Signal `task_gate_approved` when the operator approves. Signal `gate_rejected --gate-type task --reason "<reason>"` when the operator rejects.
